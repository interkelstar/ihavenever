# I Have Never Ever - Simple Game

This project is a simple 'Never Have I Ever' anonymous game that you can play with your friends

## Getting Started

To use this application you have to have Java installed on your local machine

### Run it

If you want just to run the application, simply download `ihne.jar` from `release` folder. 
Then open terminal in the folder with this jar and type:

For Windows, Linux and MacOS (for MacOS you have to run it with sudo)

```
$ java -jar ihne.jar
```

### Playing

To use application you should run it in some local network, and give IP address or host name of the host machine to people you're playing with.
In this example I will use `localhost` instead of it.

Give link to this page to all the people, one of them can create room and others will connect to it by the code, then they can ask questions until the host (who created the room) hits "Start play" and questions are shown in random order to him.

```
http://localhost/
```

## Building

You can build the application by running:

		$ ./gradlew build

To assemble new jar (that will appear in the `release` folder use this:

		$ ./gradlew bootJar

You can launch the application by running:

		$ ./gradlew bootRun


Also you can build and run using IntelliJ IDEA  Spring Boot plugin.

This project uses `kotlin-spring` plugin to avoid requiring `open` modifier on proxified
classes and methods, see [this blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/12/kotlin-1-0-6-is-here/) for more details.
This project uses a [Kotlin based Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl) configuration.
